# üèê Beach Volleyball Ontology (BVO)

This ontology models the domain of beach volleyball, including teams, athletes, matches, competitions, performances, and venues. It is designed to facilitate the analysis and interoperability of beach volleyball data using Semantic Web technologies.

## üåü Overview
The BVO aims to provide a comprehensive and interoperable model for representing and analyzing beach volleyball data. It leverages standard Semantic Web technologies, including RDF, RDFS, OWL, and SPARQL, to ensure robust data integration and querying capabilities.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Detailed Modeling**: Represents key entities such as teams, athletes, matches, competitions, and performances.
- **Interoperability**: Aligns with other ontologies like [IPTC Sport Schema](https://sportschema.org/ontologies/main) and [schema.org](https://schema.org) to ensure seamless data integration.
- **Advanced Querying**: Supports complex SPARQL queries for in-depth data analysis.
- **Inference Rules**: Includes SWRL rules for advanced reasoning and inferencing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
To use the BVO, you can download the ontology file and load it into your favorite RDF store or ontology editor such as Protege. You can then perform SPARQL queries to extract meaningful insights from your beach volleyball data.
